You know, there's a lot of jealous guys in this town
And many other towns I go to
But I'm afraid, right now, I'm so hurt
I'ma need 112 and Puff, to help me explain how I feel
So, come on fellas, help me out

Ladies, there's some jealous guys in our town
Oh, baby
Ladies, there's some jealous guys in our town
Oh, baby
(Well, well, well)

Now, would you be mad if I gave back your girl?
Or would it still be a problem with the entire Harlem World?
At first you were singing that she was your ex
But you was ready to kill me when you found out we had sex

When I came and told you the deal
You wouldn't admit how you feel
Now, you know your girl love me
Why can't you just let it be?
(Just let it be)

Ladies, there's some jealous guys in our town
Oh, baby
Ladies, there's some jealous guys in our town
Oh, baby
(Well, well, well)

Girl, I really hope you find a new lover
'Cuz Mase can't take no more of you fuckin' him and his brotha
And girl, what make you think you could do what you do
And think that we'll be standing here fighting over you? Come on

When I came and told him the deal
He wouldn't admit how he feel
Now, he know his girl love me
Why can't he just let it be?
(Just let it be)

Ladies, there's some jealous guys in our town
Oh, baby
Ladies, there's some jealous guys in our town
Oh, baby
(Well, well, well)

As I said before, I go by the name of Puffy Daddy
And I'm a Scorpio and I'm not a jealous guy
Come on, sing for me, Mase

Ladies, there's some jealous guys in our town
Oh, baby
Ladies, there's some jealous guys in our town
Oh, baby

Ladies, there's some jealous guys in our town
Oh, baby
Ladies, there's some jealous guys in our town
Oh, baby

You see if we had more pimps, it wouldn't be no jealous guys
See me, I live by the four pimp rules
Number one, you control the situation
You get in they head before you get in they bed

And number two, girls run like buses, you may miss one
Catch another one every hour on the hour, promptly
And number three, what that girl ain't willin' to do
You got a hundred more girls more than willin'

And number four, is a new rule to the new pimp testament
You can't be a playa and hate the playas
That don't make no sense

I don't wanna see no more jealous guys at the end of this song, y'all
I really don't wanna see no more jealous guys after this song, y'all
So, can y'all sing along with me
I mean put your hands together, sing along, y'all, sing along everybody

I just really wanna come and let you know
Girl, you just got to let them go
'Cuz they're jealous guys, jealous guys, in our town
And it's gonna show, love is gonna show
It's gonna show, oh, baby, it's gonna show, oh, oh

It's gonna show, it's gon', it's gon', it's gonna show
And you is a jealous guy in our town
In our town, in our town

Ooh, baby, ooh, yeah, uh, oh, uh, oh, uh, oh
Well, well, well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Where do you go when there's jealous guys in our town?
(Now, that's the end of our discussion)

To all the player haters and player hatas
Mase, Harlem World, Puff Daddy and 112
Telling you to be a lover and not a hater

You'll get further in life
May God bless you and good night
