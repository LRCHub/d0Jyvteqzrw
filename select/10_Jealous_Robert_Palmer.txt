Jealous, jealous, jealous, jealous,
Jealous, jealous,

When I see you with that guy
And he catches your pretty eye
You know it makes we want to die
And I'm left out to dry
You know it makes me want to feel
Jealous, jealous,
Jealous, jealous,

Don't you know that it makes me green
When I think about you and him
I'm just an end to all your means
And I'm torn apart at the seams
You know it makes me want to feel

Jealous, jealous,
Jealous, jealous,
When I see you with that guy
And he catches your pretty eye
You know it makes we want to die
Oh, and I'm left out to dry
You know it makes me want to feel
You know it makes me want to feel jealous, jealous,
Jealous, jealous,
Jealous, jealous,
Jealous, jealous,
Jealous, jealous,
Jealous, jealous,
Jealous, jealous,
Jealous, jealous,
