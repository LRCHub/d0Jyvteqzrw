Oh jealous heart, how you lied
You let me go without a word
I traveled far and set new roots
And seeds I'd sown are now half-grown
Jealous heart
You never told me, jealous heart
Jealous heart

Oh lovely love, angry face
I watch you wipe your tears away
Your mountains high stand so proud
And the ghosts of angels ride your seas
Jealous heart
I hear them calling, come home
Jealous heart
Jealous heart

Oh troubled love, mother's heart
You call your sons from afar
To pray for peace throughout your land
And peace becomes your lovely face
Jealous heart
Oh love of life, oh life of love
Jealous heart
Jealous heart
I never knew, oh jealous heart
Jealous heart
Jealous heart
Jealous heart
