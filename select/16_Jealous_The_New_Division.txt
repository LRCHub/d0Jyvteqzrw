I heard you say I'm in love with another
I thought you lied, saw you cry, I saw your troubles

I guess anything goes since you're not around
I start believing that your troubles
I guess anything goes when your far away
I don't need your sorrows

I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go

I know you say, to sieze the day but what of tomorrow?
It don't make no sense to play innocent, to play like your shadow

I guess anything goes since you're not around
I start believing that your troubles
I guess anything goes when you're far away
I don't need your sorrows

I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go
